## 0x17-doubly_linked_lists

# This project involves the implementation of a doubly linked list in C. A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a pointer to the previous node as well as the next node. This allows for traversal of the list in both forward and backward directions.

This folder contains files for the 0x17 C - Doubly linked lists project, in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the ALX_SE program.
Project Timeline Details

    Released: Thur Nov. 9, 2023 - 6am.
    1st Deadline: Fri Nov. 10, 2023 - 6am.
    Duration: 24 hrs.
    Month 3, Week 2, Day 4.


DESCRIPTION:

 A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains three components:
- An integer value (`n`).
- A pointer to the next node (`next`).
 -A pointer to the previous node (`prev`).
 
 APPLICATION:

 -Doubly linked lists are useful in various applications, including:
 - **Music Players**: Used to navigate to the next and previous songs.
 - **Software Engineering**: Implementing undo and redo functionalities.

Learning Objectives
 By the end of this project, you should be able to:
 - Explain what a doubly linked list is.
 Use doubly linked lists in practical applications.
- Implement various operations (insertion, deletion, traversal) on doubly linked lists.
 - Source the right information without excessive external help.

  REQUIREMENTS:
#
# - Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
# - Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
# - File Format**: All files should end with a new line.
# - README.md**: A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
# - Coding Style**: Use the Betty style. Code will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
# - Global Variables**: Not allowed.
# - Functions per File**: No more than 5 functions per file.
# - C Standard Library Functions**: Only `malloc`, `free`, `printf`, and `exit` are allowed.
# - Main.c Files**: You can use `main.c` files for testing, but do not push them to your repository.
# - Header File**: Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file called `lists.h`.
